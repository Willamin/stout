# Stout
_A web application framework designed with stout models in mind._

What's a stout model? It's a framework pattern in which models hold as much as they can.

What do Stout's models handle?
- business logic
- defining their relevant routes
- controller-ish actions
- rendering
- all of the other things!

If that's too much for _you_, never fear! You can still use Stout!
Because it's an opinionated, but _flexible_ framework, you can:
- define your routes outside of the models
- write as many controllers, controller factories, and controller factory builders as your heart desires
- use ecr template files! (no disappointed glances for doing this, seriously!)


## example

You can run a _very_ simple example app:
1. `$ shards build`
